# TOP_recipies
A project submission to [The Project Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes)

editing from vscode:
well.. this will probably be my first website(if we ignore the websites i did in the past with the help of word press(bascically i did nothing their,so this recipies is my first website XD))
what i thought was:
-sanji cooking picture
-few recipies from ratatouile movie(ignore the spelling mistakes, i mean writing this on vscode with no mispelling highlighting stuff)
-everything should be centre aligined *period.*
-should be hosted from pages.cloudflare.com
